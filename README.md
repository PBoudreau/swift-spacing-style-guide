# Introduction

This style guide means to address the proper spacing in a Swift file to achieve maximum readability. It may change over time and pull requests are greatly apreciated.

## Headers

Files should contain no headers. Any license text should be added on your project's `LICENSE.md` file, not each individual file. Autogenerated headers should not be included.

Avoid starting your files with things like:
```
//
//  Created by John Smith on 6/5/16.
//  Copyright (c) 2016 Smithy, Inc. All rights reserved.
//
```

The very first line of a file should be an `import`.

```
import Foundation
```

## Footers

Files should end with an empty line.

```
protocol MediaType {

  ...
}

```

## Imports

Each `import` should occupy a new line. No blank lines between `import`s should be added, regardless of the amount of `import`s. After all imports are declared, a blank line should be added before the entity declaration.

```
import Foundation
import MapKit

class SmithyMapViewController {

  ...
```

## Blocks of Code

All blocks of code, in general should be treated the same. A block of code is delimited by `{` and `}`. A few rules apply to this.

** 1. Opening **
It always leaves a space from the same line as the code that's declaring this block. Afterwards, a blank line should always be added.

```
class MyView: UIView {

  ...
}
```

or

```
while (condition == true) {

  ...
}

or

```
myView.keepAnimatedWithDuration(interval) {

  ...
}
```

** 2. Closing **

** 3. Intermediate **
} else {

** 4. Chaninng **
.map {
}
